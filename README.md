# CS231n-2016
All homework assignments for the early 2016 Stanford **_CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition_** class.

Great thanks to Fei-Fei Li, Andrej Karpathy & Justin Johnson for publicly sharing the lectures, sheets and assignments for this class.

I can highly recommend it for anybody aiming to learn more about this field.

Obviously this content is meant as references for your answers, as (mainly towards the end) it is not always clear which code is right or wrong. There are a few more great answer decks out there, yet these are not consistent (nor is this one inherently). I did however my best in cross checking my code and believe it is of decent standart.
I therefore hope anybody who is looking for references for their code will find this repository useful.

### Good luck and have fun!
